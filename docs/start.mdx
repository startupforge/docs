Welcome to Startup Forge. This is an _opinionated_ version of the information I wish I was told when building a startup. Knowing this advice would have saved me months of work, so I'd like to share it with you.

This resource is built for people with a technical background. In the beginning there is some non technical work, but I'll mostly focus on building a good production ready tech stack. I won't overly prioritize _free_ software. When a paid service can save time at a reasonable price I'll recommend it.

## Startup School

I highly recommend going through the first 3-5 modules in the free [Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org/) curriculum. These lectures from YC partners can help avoid common mistakes that cause startups to fail.
