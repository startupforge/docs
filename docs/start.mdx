Welcome to Startup Forge. This is an _opinionated_ version of the information I wish I was told when building a startup. Knowing this advice would have saved me months of work, so I'd like to share it with you.

This resource is built for people with a technical background. In the beginning there is some non technical work, but I'll mostly focus on building a good production ready tech stack. I won't overly prioritize _free_ software. When a paid service can save time at a reasonable price I'll recommend it.

## The Broad Steps

<Steps>

    Decide on some of the basic aspects required for a business.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write the code">
    Start organizing a codebase that can launch quickly and grow with your team.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch and grow">
    Show the world your product and start getting more users.

## Startup School

I highly recommend going through the first 3-5 modules in the free [Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org/) curriculum. These lectures from YC partners can help avoid common mistakes that cause startups to fail.

# Decide What to Build

There are two obviously good ways to _start_ a startup. Either start with a **really good problem**, or start with a **really good team**. Both can work and there are lots of good resources out there about choosing a problem or choosing a co-founder(s).

## Solution in Search of a Problem

Avoid starting by picking a cool technology and later finding a problem it solves. This is called a solution in search of a problem (SISP). It's a common issue, because it's pretty fun and you can easily convince yourself it's a good idea. It tends to not work out because your users are almost always better served by starting with their actual problem rather than starting with your "cool technology".
