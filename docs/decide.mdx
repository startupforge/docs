# Decide What to Build

There are two obviously good ways to _start_ a startup. Either start with a **really good problem**, or start with a **really good team**. Both can work and there are lots of good resources out there about choosing a problem or choosing a co-founder(s).

## Solution in Search of a Problem

Avoid starting by picking a cool technology and later finding a problem it solves. This is called a solution in search of a problem (SISP). It's a common issue, because it's pretty fun and you can easily convince yourself it's a good idea. It tends to not work out because your users are almost always better served by starting with their actual problem rather than starting with your "cool technology".
